=== OpenCV installation ===



=== Playstation Eye SDK installation ===
(This is the guide for installation under Windows using the CodeLaboratories CL-Eye Platform SDK))
- Download the CL-Eye Platform SDK (not only the driver) available at
http://codelaboratories.com/downloads/
- Install the SDK including code samples (API is installed only in this case).
- Locate the header and lib files installed (may be in your standard documents directory in C:\Users\...)
- Define the environment variable CLEYESDKDIR to point to this directory (the one from which Include and Lib, without a "/" at the end of the variable value.)
- Now you should be able to compile the SMEyeL projects related to PS3Eye.
